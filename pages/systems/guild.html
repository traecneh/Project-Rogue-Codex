          <h2>Core Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            As soon as you tag up, the game treats your guildmates as trusted allies. The default PvP rules relax,
            allowing you to operate as a unit even in chaotic encounters. These perks stay active anywhere in the world.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Safe Looting:</strong> Looting your guildmate&rsquo;s body never flags you criminal. You can help
              them recover or secure key drops without the legal fallout.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accelerated De-crim:</strong> You can remove criminal status faster while on-screen with guildmates.
              Staying near the crew turns the timer in your favor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Target Protection Toggle:</strong> Enable guild target protection to ignore allies with friendly fire
              abilities. It’s perfect for tight skirmishes where misclicks would otherwise wipe a teammate.
            </li>

          <h2>Guild Party System</h2>
          <p>
            Project Rogue folds party features directly into every guild. You don’t have to juggle separate invites&mdash;
            the moment you join, the interface tracks everyone online and gives you combat clarity.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Party Interface:</strong> The guild panel shows each member&rsquo;s name, current health, and max
              health. A matching overlay hits the minimap and world map with diamond icons so you never lose sight of
              positioning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Health-based Map Icons:</strong> The diamonds adopt a traffic-light color scheme: green above 70%
              health, yellow between 40%&ndash;70%, and red under 40%. Color shifts give instant reads on who needs help.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Drop Callouts:</strong> Chat pings any loot that rolls with rarity while a guildmate is nearby, so
              everyone can plan upgrades or trades.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flexible Sub-groups:</strong> Break into three sub-teams labeled <strong>[A]</strong>,
              <strong>[B]</strong>, and <strong>[C]</strong> directly inside the guild panel. Use them to assign roles or
              split duty mid-run.
            </li>
